# Matrix-CSS-Rain

A **single-file** homage to *The Matrix* built with **pure HTML + CSS—zero JavaScript, zero dependencies**.

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser and click the green floor tiles to “walk” the scene.
- Everything—digital rain, 3-D camera shifts, hover glow—runs on CSS keyframes and selectors alone.
